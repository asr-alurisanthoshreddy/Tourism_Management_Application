# Tourism Management Application

## Problem Statement

The tourism industry plays a crucial role in global economic development, yet it faces several challenges such as disorganized booking systems, lack of centralized customer records, and inefficient communication between service providers and tourists. Traditional tourism management processes rely on manual operations like offline bookings, paper-based documentation, and fragmented communication channels, leading to errors, delays, and poor customer satisfaction.

Tourists often struggle to access reliable information about destinations, tour packages, and pricing, while tourism operators face difficulties in managing customer data, handling bookings, and offering personalized services. The absence of integration across departments further complicates workflows, resulting in reduced efficiency and lost business opportunities.

Hence, there is a need for a **centralized, automated Tourism Management System** that streamlines end-to-end processes, enhances customer engagement, and improves operational efficiency.

   * Payment tracking and invoice generation are fully automated within Salesforce.

5. **Schema & Data Management**

   * Entities like **Users, Destinations, Packages, Hotels, Transport, Payments, Feedback** are modeled as **Objects**.
   * Their relationships are visualized in **Schema Builder** for clear understanding and scalability.
