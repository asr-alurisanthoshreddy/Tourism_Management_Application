## Problem Statement

A global university aims to gain **holistic visibility and control over each student's complete journey**, spanning from initial application, admissions, academic progress, extracurricular engagements, to post-graduation alumni activities. The institution currently operates multiple internal systems such as admissions, Learning Management System (LMS), and events management, as well as interacts with various external platforms like social media and alumni networks. These fragmented systems present challenges in obtaining a unified, insightful view and responsive engagement strategy for students and alumni.

The university requires a **robust solution built on the Salesforce Developer platform** that integrates these internal and external data sources, enabling seamless mapping of individual student journeys and alumni interactions. The system should intelligently trigger personalized communications such as academic alerts, event invitations, and fundraising campaigns. Utilizing Salesforce's automation, flow management, and AI-driven predictive analytics capabilities, the solution should reduce student drop-off rates, boost academic success, and improve alumni involvement and fundraising efficacy.
