## Problem Statement

The tourism industry plays a crucial role in economic development but continues to face major challenges in terms of service management, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Traditional tourism management practices rely heavily on manual processes such as offline bookings, paper-based records, and fragmented communication channels, which often lead to errors, delays, and poor customer experiences.

Tourists frequently encounter difficulties in accessing reliable information about tour packages, destinations, and pricing. Additionally, travel agencies and tourism operators struggle to maintain customer records, manage bookings efficiently, and handle payments in a secure and streamlined way. The lack of integration between booking systems, customer support, and feedback mechanisms further complicates the process, resulting in reduced customer trust and missed opportunities for businesses.

Therefore, there is a need for a centralized, automated, and scalable Tourism Management System that can bring all stakeholders—tourists, travel agencies, and service providers—onto a single platform. By leveraging Salesforce, the Tourism Management Application aims to provide an end-to-end solution that simplifies tour package creation, booking, customer management, and feedback tracking while ensuring seamless user experience and operational efficiency.
